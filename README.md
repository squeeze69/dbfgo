dbfgo - forked from jeffycf/dbfgo
=====


Basicall, this fork is quite old, I suggest to use another fork of mine [squeeze69/dbf](https://github.com/squeeze69/dbf)

this library reads the *.dbf file with golang

- Some changes to package it
- now it takes in account malformed field name (some Clipper code doesn't Fill
with 0 the name)
